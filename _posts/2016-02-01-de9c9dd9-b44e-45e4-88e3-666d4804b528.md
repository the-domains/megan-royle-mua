I'm a qualified Theatrical Hair and Makeup artist. I trained at the world-class [Delamar Academy][0] at Ealing Studios.

Whether I'm making an actor appear dead, creating an androgynous Boy George look, working a wig into an early Victorian hair-do or prepping skin for a flawless, dewy look, I've developed a range of skills and knowledge that cross fashion shoots, theatre and TV.

Having spent two years of my life working my way around Australia on farms and in restaurants and bars I appreciate what it takes to get on with new people in new places. It's helped shape my confidence and approach to make-up artistry. I know how important it is to quickly get up to speed with what's needed on film set or fashion shoot, get on with the team and produce great-looking results.
